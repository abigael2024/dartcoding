void main() {
  // Example of int data type
  int age = 25;
  print('Age: $age');

  // Example of double data type
  double height = 5.11;
  print('Height: $height ft');

  // Example of String data type
  String name = 'John Doe';
  print('Name: $name');

  // Example of List data type (List of integers)
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  print('Numbers: $numbers');

  // Example of accessing elements in a list
  print('First number: ${numbers[0]}');
  print('Second number: ${numbers[1]}');

  // Example of adding an element to the list
  numbers.add(6);
  print('Updated Numbers: $numbers');

  // Example of Map data type (Map of String keys and int values)
  Map<String, int> studentScores = {
    'Alice': 85,
    'Bob': 92,
    'Charlie': 78,
  };
  print('Student Scores: $studentScores');

  // Example of accessing values in a map using keys
  print('Bob\'s Score: ${studentScores['Bob']}');

  // Example of adding a new entry to the map
  studentScores['David'] = 88;
  print('Updated Student Scores: $studentScores');

This program defines various variables of different data types, assigns values to them, and then prints them out. Here's a brief explanation of each data type and its use in the program:

int: Represents integer numbers. In this program, age is an integer variable storing the age of a person.

double: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). In this program, height is a double variable storing the height of a person.

String: Represents a sequence of characters. In this program, name is a string variable storing the name of a person.

List: Represents an ordered collection of objects. In this program, numbers is a list of integers representing a collection of numbers.

Map: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. In this program, studentScores is a map where each student's name is associated with their score.
Running this program will output:
Age: 25
Height: 5.11 ft
Name: John Doe
Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
First number: 1
Second number: 2
Updated Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Student Scores: {Alice: 85, Bob: 92, Charlie: 78}
Bob's Score: 92
Updated Student Scores: {Alice: 85, Bob: 92, Charlie: 78, David: 88}
